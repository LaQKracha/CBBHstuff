# Just Useful web stuff
There are two scripts to help us with the payloads, those are `iP2Pa.py` and `tA2Pa.py`
## iP2Pa.py
Used to replace the `OUR_IP` occurrences on the contents of this repo with your IP, avoiding you to change those manually

## iP2Pa.py
Used to replace the `TARGET_IP` occurrences on the contents of this repo with your target's IP, avoiding you to change those manually

## How to Use

Just clone the repository, and use it haha ðŸ’»ðŸ”¥

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sa1tty/CBBHstuff.git
```
